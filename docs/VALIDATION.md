# kubewhy — validation evidence

The authoritative record of what has been tested, how, and what the result does
and does not support. Four words are used and they mean specific things:

- **PROVEN** — tested directly, result reproducible
- **PARTIALLY PROVEN** — tested, but the evidence is narrower than the claim
- **UNDETERMINED** — measured, and the sample does not settle it
- **NOT TESTED** — no evidence; the claim is not made

## Defects found and fixed

Each of these was found by testing, not by review. The pattern is the same
throughout: **test → failure → root cause → fix → regression test →
re-validation.**

### 1. Endpoint classification bypass (HIGH, adversarial validation)

**Problem.** An external endpoint could be spelled so it classified as internal,
defeating the external-data policy entirely.

**Detection.** Adversarial validation, deliberately attacking the egress
boundary.

**Root cause.** The classifier and the HTTP client parsed the endpoint
*separately*. IDN full stops (`。`) and integer-form IPv4 normalised differently
in each. Two parsers on one string agree only by coincidence.

**Fix.** Both normalise through the same parser, by construction. IP literals are
short-circuited before normalisation — a first repair broke IPv6, classifying
`::1` and `fd00::1` as external.

**Regression evidence.** Classifier tests including IDN, integer IPv4 and IPv6
literals. Shipped in v0.1.8; **v0.1.7 must not be used.**

### 2. Target re-derived from the prompt (HIGH)

**Problem.** Every scoped investigation died on
`{"result": "no workload named example exists in this cluster"}`.

**Detection.** Driving the console by hand. It reproduced identically on
gpt-4o-mini *and* qwen3, which is what showed it was not the model.

**Root cause.** The loop discarded the target it was handed and recovered it by
parsing the prompt `scoped_question()` had just written. `_NAME_FIRST` matches
`"<name> <kind>"` — the shape of "the crasher deployment" — so
`(for example pod nightly-sync-abc)` yielded a workload called `example`. Removing
that phrase yielded `other`, from "Do not report on any **other workload**".
`enforce()` then rewrote every call to the phantom, **including calls the model
had got right.**

**Fix.** `scoped_target()` builds the target from the same selection the prompt
is built from; `stream(target=…)` uses it verbatim. Parsing survives only for
surfaces that genuinely have only a sentence.

**Regression evidence.** 20 tests in `tests/test_investigation_identity.py`,
two workloads in different namespaces; 14 confirmed red against the previous
code. Verified live: 16/16 chain-identity checks across two real investigations.

### 3. Investigation deadline was per provider, not per investigation

**Problem.** A fallback got a fresh deadline. A 2s budget produced a 4.01s run.

**Detection.** A requirement written down, then tested against.

**Root cause.** The deadline was computed per `chat()` call rather than per
investigation.

**Fix.** One deadline per investigation, shared. When exhausted the fallback is
skipped and logged as `fallback_skipped_deadline_exhausted`.

**Regression evidence.** 38 deadline tests, including a boundary case where a
first repair raced (`remaining()` returned 0.001s positive) and an `int()`
truncation that fired a second early.

### 4. Contradiction detection: two false-positive classes

**Problem.** The first contradiction rules produced **six false positives and
zero true ones** against the recorded corpus.

**Detection.** Corpus replay, before shipping.

**Root cause.** (a) any number near "cpu"/"memory" was read as a limit — the
`stress` fixture logs `dispatching hogs: 0 cpu, 0 io` and six correct answers
quoting it were scored as claiming a CPU limit of zero; (b) negation was not
handled — `no OOMKilled reported` matched on presence.

**Fix.** The numeric rule requires the word `limit` or `request`; a negation
window was added.

**Then two more, live.** After 432 real investigations: an absence claim attached
to the wrong entity, and "to avoid OOMKilled" read as an assertion. Fixed with
`_absence_is_about()` and a prospective-framing guard. **Only running live found
these** — no recorded answer had ever phrased it that way.

**Regression evidence.** `tests/test_contradiction.py`, where the
false-positive half is the larger half.

### 5. Grounding could say CONTRADICTED but not SUPPORTED

**Problem.** Both models answered `service_selector_typo` correctly and both
scored `insufficient_evidence` — "nothing here could be checked" — while
`get_service_endpoints` had returned the empty lists that settle the claim.

**Detection.** The n=1 evaluation baseline, then confirmed as systematic across
45 recorded runs.

**Root cause.** The contract recognised measurable figures and known statuses.
The answer asserts a *relation* with neither, so `checked == 0`.

**Fix.** The same `_ABSENCE` predicate and `endpoints_total` fact already driving
the contradiction rule, in the other direction. A confirmation requires the tool
to have been **called** — confirming an absence from silence would be an
unfalsifiable tick.

**Regression evidence.** Replayed over 907 runs **three times**, because the
first two drafts were wrong: draft 1 called 9 correct answers contradicted
(ready and not-ready endpoints were counted together); draft 2 called 2 more
contradicted (a heading and a conditional antecedent). Final: **45
`insufficient_evidence → grounded`, 0 regressions.** 9 new tests.

### 6. A console that had never rendered its worst case

**Problem.** `st.error(icon="✕")` is not a valid emoji. Streamlit raised and
**blanked the page on every contradiction** — the one verdict most worth reading.

**Detection.** The first test that rendered a contradiction at all.

**Root cause.** No test had ever produced a contradiction to render.

**Fix.** A valid icon, and the AppTest helper now asserts `app.exception` is
empty on every panel test.

### 7. The investigation target moved on its own

**Problem.** The selected workload silently became a different one.

**Detection.** Observed in the browser, then reproduced deterministically.

**Root cause.** Two, found in sequence: the selectbox had no `key`, so selection
was positional and a re-ordered scan moved it; and when the selected workload
*left* the scan — which `only_unhealthy` and a CronJob both cause routinely —
the index fell back to 0. Measured: `demo/nightly-sync → demo/bad-image`, no
warning.

**Fix.** Keyed and re-anchored by value; a workload that leaves the scan stays
selected with a warning naming it.

**Regression evidence.** Both cases tested and confirmed red against the
previous code. Verified live by repairing a workload underneath a selection.

### 8. A nondeterministic evaluation fixture

**Problem.** `cronjob_runs_are_one_workload` failed because the pod it was told
about was deleted mid-investigation.

**Root cause.** The CronJob fired every minute keeping two failures — ~2 minutes
of pod life against a 72s-median investigation.

**Fix.** In the **fixture**, not the agent and not the expectation: `*/5` with six
retained, ~30 minutes against a 4-minute worst case.

## Test-harness failures worth recording

Three times a harness reported a clean result it had not earned. Recording them
because a validation document that only lists product defects is not honest
about how validation actually goes.

- **Two vacuous UI tests** passed against known-broken code — one asserted a
  caption that a previous test had already made absent; one stubbed a `namespaces=`
  kwarg while `ui.py` calls positionally, so the filter never narrowed anything.
- **The grounding replay reported "zero changes" twice** — first from stale
  `__pycache__`, then because copies of `grounding.py` and `contradiction.py` sat
  beside the replay script, and Python puts the script's directory ahead of
  `PYTHONPATH`. Both compared the new code against itself.
- **An adversarial eval case passed 3/3 while its payload never reached the
  model.** Cases now declare `payload` and the run fails if it did not arrive.

A "no regressions" result that has not proved it exercised two different versions
is not a result.

## Reproducing

```bash
pytest                                   # 977, no cluster or model needed

kind create cluster --name kubewhy
kubectl apply -f demo/broken-pods.yaml -f demo/config-faults.yaml \
              -f demo/tricky-pods.yaml -f demo/adversarial.yaml

TRIAGE_INFERENCE_MODE=local TRIAGE_MODEL=qwen3 \
  caffeinate -is python evals/run_eval.py --repeat 5 --json results/local.json
python evals/report_baseline.py results/local.json
```

`caffeinate -is` is not optional for an unattended run: two months of "Ollama
stalls" turned out to be the laptop sleeping.
